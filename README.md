This is a personal Android project developed for learning and portfolio purposes. It is not related to any past or current employer.

This Android application is a personal, prototype-oriented project developed using Kotlin and XML layouts, focused on Japanese language study.

The main goal of the app is to allow users to take photos or select images containing everyday signs or short texts, analyze the extracted text, and identify the words and kanji that appear.
Based on this analysis, the application tracks appearance frequency of words and kanji in order to prioritize study targets.
The app also provides readings and meanings for detected vocabulary and kanji, allowing users to easily look up linguistic information within the application.
Additionally, the app offers the ability to export selected words and kanji as CSV files or add them directly to Anki decks, enabling seamless integration with spaced-repetition study workflows.
